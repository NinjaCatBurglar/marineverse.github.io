Hello Metaverse! :-)

With the begining of 2016, MarineVerse was born. It will focus on creating virtual reality content for people interested in sailing.

Our first goal is to create compelling "Introduction to sailing" experience for Google Cardboard.

## Demo apps

Working towards the goal, we already created 2 simple demo apps:

### Point of Sail

## Next steps

Our plan is to continue making and improving "Introduction to sailing" app demos, getting to the point where we have a comprehensive app for Google Cardboard.

We have lots of ideas what to build and how to improve and we are looking forward to hearing your thoughts. Please comment below:
