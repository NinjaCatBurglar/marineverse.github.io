The MarineVerse team, Greg & Olga, had a chance to spend some time in Hobart during the Sydney to Hobart race. Pictures and comments by Greg below:

 > We took a few photos, some of them using Google Cardboard Camera App that we would like to share with you.

If you have Google Cardboard, you can get a taste of virtually being there for real.
