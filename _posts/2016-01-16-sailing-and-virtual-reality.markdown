Hi there :-)

I guess you are interested in sailing and virtual reality? Perfect!

We are trying to combine our passion for both, and we are looking for community help.

Please let us know:

<!--more-->

1. **What VR device do you have access to?**.. Google cardboard, GearVR, Oculus Rift, HTC Vive or something else?

1. **What kind of experience would you like to see build?** Maybe "theory of sailing", nomenclature, rules, virtual taverna or something else?

Please comment below and hopefully we will be able to deliver something you want :-)
