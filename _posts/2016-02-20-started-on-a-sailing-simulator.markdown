This is an early build of the game and we are interested a lot in your feedback on how to improve it. Dreaming of a great sailing in VR? Why not try "Sail to Freedom" and help us improve it.

What's included:

- sailing around, using gaze and pointer click to pick a direction.
- sailing upwind is hard, sailing downwind is easy.
- main sail positioned more or less correctly with relation to the wind.

The biggest question:

- is the movment in the game comfortable for you?
