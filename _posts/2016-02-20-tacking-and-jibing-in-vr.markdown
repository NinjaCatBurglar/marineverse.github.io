Ahoy Friends,

Happy to share with you our new sailing Google Cardboard VR experiment.

Learn about [tacking and jibing in virtual reality](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.marineverse.tackingjibing).

In this experience, you will start at a lighthouse. From there, you will have a perfect view for a sailboat that is going around the course, tacking and jibing.

From the lighthouse, you can teleport to two alternative locations: the moving sailboat or to the one that is anchored nearby. To teleport, simply look at a boat and use a Cardboard trigger button to select.

What makes this demo special, is that we let you move with the boat. This mode might be uncomfortable for some, so please let us know if this works for you, or if you feel sea sick.

[Install the app for free](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.marineverse.tackingjibing).

Please share any ideas or feedback you have in comments.
