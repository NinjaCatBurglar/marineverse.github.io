Ahoy!

This long easter weekend MarineVerse team is organizing and attending the first Sailing VR Jam.

Ok, it's only 1 team and two of us, Greg & Olga.. but we are having a great time nonetheless ;)

This is a quick summary of our day 1.

<!--more-->

We have:

  - improved "Sailing Terms" app and [released GearVR version](http://sideloadvr.com/detail.php?id=10002).
  - brainstormed and created personas and  "User Journey" for MarineVerse.
  - build VR ready PC and set up our Vive Pre.


Not too bad as for a day 1. Three more days to go :-)
