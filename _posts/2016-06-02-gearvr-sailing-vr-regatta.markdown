**Exciting news:** Along with launch on Steam, VR Regatta has been approved "for keys" on Oculus store.

With the beta key for VR Regatta, you can now access the game from you Library on GearVR and easily get updates as we ship them.

Whatâ€™s coming for VR Regatta on GearVR:

 - Improvements, polish, bug fixes
 - Integration with Oculus API - Leaderboards, Achievements etc.
 - Multiplayer
 - Maybe cross platform multiplayer with HTC Vive version (and you can actually control the boat as opposed to Google Cardboards guys stuck flying seagulls ;))

You can help in bringing sailing to GearVR - let us know you are interested in providing feedback and **beta testing by contacting us at feedback@marineverse.com** and we will send you a special access key.
