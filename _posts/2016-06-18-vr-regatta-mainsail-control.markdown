We have just shipped VR Regatta 0.2 for HTC Vive on Steam.

The most important feature: **You can control sails by grabbing mainsheet**

With this new feature, your both hands can be busy holding the tiller and mainsail sheet. Your Vive sailing is now even more immersive :-)

Another important feature in this version - you can buy "coins" to support VR Regatta development. Coins can be used to "vote" on what should we work next:

The next big feature we are currently working on is multiplayer.

VR Regatta is Early Access free to play game. We hope that many of you are excited about sailing in virtual reality. If you want more and better sailing in VR please consider voting with your wallet by funding our project.

It can be as little as <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/buyitem/468240/100/1" target="_blank">0.99$</a> or as much as <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/buyitem/468240/100/100" target="_blank">$99.00</a> :-)

A daily rate of a good developer in Australia can easily be above $1000AUD and that just an example of the costs (<a href="http://store.steampowered.com/buyitem/468240/100/900" target="_blank">click here to fully fund developer for 1 day</a>).
