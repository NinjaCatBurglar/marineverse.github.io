We've just shipped a new version of our HTC Vive sailing game VR Regatta - 0.5.

<!--more-->

Big changes in this version:

  * A brand new yacht with a wheel
  * An improved virtual water. Small waves at the moment and a possibility of a gale size waves in the future.

There was also a bunch of smaller improvments, for example:

This is just a beginning of improvements yet to come to VR Regatta. Some of the things we want to focus on next:

  * Mainsheet - improve how it looks and works. Also adding other ropes on the boat.
  * Another iteration of visual improvments. Nicer boats, nicer environments.
  * Adding more interactivity to the sailboats. For example raising the sails, grabbing the boom, etc.

The latest version of the game was brought to you by MarineVerse team: Greg, Olga, David & Nate.
