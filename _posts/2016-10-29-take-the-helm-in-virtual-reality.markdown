Sail in controlled environments and scenarios with immersive head and hand tracking. Virtual reality (VR) enables hands-on sailing training and education from your home; to reinforce what you are learning on the water or even prior to ever stepping onto a sailboat for novices.

## New to sailing?
Go at your own pace, focusing on a given subject for as long as necessary. Your instructor will be able to join you in the virtual world if you need anything specific explained.

## Advanced sailor?
Hone your skills, brush up on rules, or train with other sailors from around the world or with your own real life crew.

## Landlocked sailor?
Limited access to a sailboat? Poor sailing weather? In virtual reality, conditions may be prescribed exactly.
