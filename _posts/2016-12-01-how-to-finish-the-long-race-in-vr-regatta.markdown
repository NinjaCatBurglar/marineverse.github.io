In this video our sailing expert Nate demonstrates our system for detecting Right of Way on the water and shows how to finish the Long Race - discussing some racing tactics.

Nate had a pretty good run in the Long Race, finishing 3rd on [the Leaderboard](http://steamcommunity.com/stats/468240/leaderboards/1473807) at the time of writting.

We are planning on creating more of those sailing tutorial videos, discussing different aspects of sailing, using virtual reality to showcase it.

Please let us know ( feedback@marineverse.com ) what you think, how can we make it better and suggest topics you would want us to cover in the future.
