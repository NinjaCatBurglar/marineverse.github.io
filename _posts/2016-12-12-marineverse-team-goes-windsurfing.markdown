Thanks to invitation by Australian Sailing Team RS:X coach Max WÃ³jcik, Olga and Greg had a chance to to participate in Introduction to Windsurfing day in Elwood Sailing Club.

It was a great day, with perfect conditions to do some research into what windsurfing is all about. Great material to take our VR windsurfing further :-)

But researching windsurfing was not the only reason for our field trip. Our second objective was to user test our introduction to sailing app - Points of Sail:

The test went pretty well, with young sailors being immersed in virtual reality just before going on the water.

So what did we learn during the test?

  * **Simplify content** - current version uses fairly technical vocabulary and complex thoery. We need to look into using simpler terms and possibly simplifying what are we are trying to teach.
  * **Voice** - robotic voice we have at the moment is not the most pleasant to listen to. Using a voice actor would make using the app more enjoyable.
  * **Sailors asked for more** - actual virtual reality sailing (like in [VR Regatta](http://store.steampowered.com/app/468240)) - not just stationary sailing lesson.

If you are interested in testing the Points of Sail app yourself, it's available on [Google Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.marineverse.pointofsail&hl=en).
