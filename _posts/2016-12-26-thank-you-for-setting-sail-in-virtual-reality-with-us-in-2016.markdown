We’ve started working on virtual reality sailing in January 2016. Throughout the year we received valuable comments and feedback that kept us going - Thank you! :-)


We wish you successful 2017 - let it be even better for virtual reality then 2016 was!


If you have a moment to comment - what’s your personal virtual reality sailing wish for 2017?


All the best,

Greg, Olga, Nate & David
