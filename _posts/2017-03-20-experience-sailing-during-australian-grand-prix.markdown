[VR Regatta](http://store.steampowered.com/app/468240) is a virtual reality sailing simulator for HTC Vive designed for people with and without previous sailing experience.

By utilizing the advances in virtual reality technology, users interested in relaxing, racing, and training are now able to immerse themselves in a highly immersive sailing experience.

The ability to use hand motion tracking allows users to intuitively control their boat in a way that realistically mirrors the physical interactions of sailing. This creates a level of physical depth and awareness, that had previously not been possible with keyboard and mouse.

During a short demo experience, users will be able to learn some basic sailing terms and get familiar with VR, experience controlling a large sailing yacht and participate in a short race.  They will proceed to finish their session with a relaxing sunset sail in a small dinghy.

VR Regatta is being developed by [MarineVerse](https://www.marineverse.com/), a small international team of sailors, based in Melbourne, Toronto and San Francisco.
