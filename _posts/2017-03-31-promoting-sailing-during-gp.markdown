Last weekend over 100 people tried virtual reality sailing experience delivered by MarineVerse during Australian Grand Prix:

Our VR sailing game [VR Regatta](http://store.steampowered.com/app/468240) attracted attention from kids and their parents:

The stand was in Kids Sporting Zone in Albert Park - different sports had a chance to attract attention of Grand Prix visitors and MarineVerse took on a challenge to let people experience sailing without getting on the water.

While people were waiting to try the game, we've been offering information about opportunities to try real sailing in [The Boatshed](https://theboatshed.net.au/):

We used HTC Vive as our VR sailing gear:

The ranks of [VR Regatta sailors](https://www.marineverse.com/members/vr-regatta-sailors) were joined by Australian Sailing instructors:

And upcoming sailing champions *(It was great to see, that thanks to intuitive hand controllers, first time VR users were picking up the game in no time)*:

Thanks to VR-ready laptop, our setup was very mobile and worked in the field. *(We've been lucky with the weather - wind and bright sun don't play nicely with HTC Vive tracking system )*

We would like to say "thank you" to everyone who tried VR Regatta and to Australian Sailing and The Boatshed for hosting us.
